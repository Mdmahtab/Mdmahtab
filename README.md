- 👋 Hi, I’m @mdmahtab
- 👀 I’m interested in the utility of data in solving real-world problems, especially those related to finance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL, the two most sought-after tools in a data science role.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects, I could be your assistant buddy since I'm a total newb in this domain with a non-STEM UG background.
- 📫 You can reach me at alam@mahtabjournal.com.
